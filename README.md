# Mobile-Xbox-Store-Update-
An improved look at the front page of Microsoft Store on Xbox's mobile application allowing for easier use and improved flow. 

A personal project focusing on improving the user interface of the front page of the Microsoft Store dashboard on Xbox's mobile application. The Microsoft store allows users to be able to view and purchase mainly Xbox games as well as movies and tv shows. 

The current user interface is simplistic yet disregards one of Microsoft's key features: current sales or deals. 

In my design, Microsoft would highlight their current sales or any games on a deal or price drop. This mimics the current dashboard on the Xbox itself. I find this to be a pivitol aspect missing from the Microsoft dashboard within the Xbox applicaiton. 

Current applicaiton dashboard:
